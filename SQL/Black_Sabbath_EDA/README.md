# 1. Creating the Dataset: API calls
* First, the API call needs to be made so we get the right information. The Python program sends a *get* request for artist name, track name, track popularity index, track id, and audio features.

```Python
import requests
import pandas as pd

    credentials_b64 = base64.b64encode(f"{client_id}:{client_secret}".encode()).decode()

    headers = {"Authorization": f"Basic {credentials_b64}"}
    payload = {"grant_type": "client_credentials"}

    response = requests.post(auth_url, headers=headers, data=payload)
    response.raise_for_status()
    access_token = response.json()['access_token']
    return access_token


def get_artist_id(artist_name, access_token):

    }
```
* We unify the previous snippets through a main() function which sets *Black Sabbath* as the artist name and creates a list with the markets (countries) we want to explore.
  
```Python
def main():
    artist_name = 'Black Sabbath'
    markets = ["CA", "DE", "FR", "GB", "JP", "MX", "US"]
    access_token = get_spotify_access_token()

    artist_id = get_artist_id(artist_name, access_token)
    if not artist_id:
        print(f"Could not find artist ID for {artist_name}")
        return

    all_tracks_features = []  # List to store features of tracks from all markets

    for market in markets:
        top_tracks = get_top_tracks_for_artists(artist_id, access_token, market)
        
        for track in top_tracks:
            track_features = {
                "artist_name": track["artist_name"],
                "track_name": track["track_name"],
                "track_id": track["track_id"],
                "market": market,
                "popularity": track["popularity"],
                "track_url": track["track_url"]
            }
    
            track_audio_features = get_tracks_audio_feats(access_token, track['track_id'])
            combined_track_info = {**track_features, **track_audio_features}
            all_tracks_features.append(combined_track_info)

    df = pd.DataFrame(all_tracks_features)
    
    return df
```
</details>

This is an overwview of how the created dataset looks:

![SQL_1](https://github.com/zefrios/SQL/assets/83305620/991c1711-6c82-426f-8a31-a09aeccf06b9)

* Once the data is correctly extracted and placed into a dataframe, it is transferred to a SQL table for further analysis:

<details>
<summary>Click to see code</summary>

```Python
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///spotify_track_info.db')

df_spotify_tracks.to_sql(name='spotify_track_info', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
print("Data stored in the 'spotify_track_info' table.")
```
</details>

With the dataset ready, we can proceed to querying the data from SQL to answer some exploratory questions.
***

# 2. Exploring the dataset: SQL Queries
Audio features were extracted to explore Spotify's measurements per track. To clarify what each of these are, here are the descriptions from their website:

- Acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
  
- Danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

- Energy: Measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
  
- Loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.
  
- Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.

## 1. How many distinct tracks are there in the dataset?

```SQL
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT track_id) AS unique_tracks
FROM spotify_track_info
```
![SQL_Q1](https://github.com/zefrios/SQL/assets/83305620/bf9863e8-eba4-45be-8616-f07c40f02693)


## 2. What are the average values of acousticness, danceability, duration (in minutes), energy, loudness, and tempo for all tracks?

```SQL
SELECT
ROUND(AVG(acousticness), 2) AS avg_acousticness,
ROUND(AVG(danceability), 2) AS avg_danceability,
ROUND(AVG((duration_ms)/60000), 2) AS avg_track_duration,
ROUND(AVG(energy), 2) AS avg_energy,
ROUND(AVG(loudness), 2) AS avg_loudness,
ROUND(AVG(tempo), 2) AS avg_tempo
FROM spotify_track_info
```

| avg_acousticness | avg_danceability | avg_track_duration | avg_energy | avg_loudness | avg_tempo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.23|0.39|4.6|0.54|-13.51|123.45

## 3. What are the most popular songs in each country?
```SQL
SELECT track_name, market, popularity,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY popularity DESC) AS popularity_rank
FROM df_spotify_tracks
ORDER BY popularity DESC
```
| track_name | market | popularity | popularity_rank |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | DE | 84 | 1 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | FR | 84 | 1 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | GB | 84 | 1 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | JP | 84 | 1 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | MX | 84 | 1 |
| Paranoid - 2012 - Remaster | CA | 77 | 2 |
| Paranoid - 2012 - Remaster | US | 77 | 2 |
| Iron Man (2009 - Remaster) | DE | 75 | 3 |
| Iron Man (2009 - Remaster) | FR | 75 | 3 |
| Iron Man (2009 - Remaster) | GB | 75 | 3 |
| Iron Man (2009 - Remaster) | JP | 75 | 3 |
| Iron Man (2009 - Remaster) | MX | 75 | 3 |
| War Pigs (2009 - Remaster) | DE | 72 | 4 |
| War Pigs (2009 - Remaster) | FR | 72 | 4 |
| War Pigs (2009 - Remaster) | GB | 72 | 4 |
| War Pigs (2009 - Remaster) | JP | 72 | 4 |
| War Pigs (2009 - Remaster) | MX | 72 | 4 |
| Iron Man - 2012 - Remaster | CA | 69 | 5 |
| Iron Man - 2012 - Remaster | US | 69 | 5 |
| War Pigs / Luke's Wall - 2012 - Remaster | CA | 68 | 6 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | DE | 68 | 6 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | FR | 68 | 6 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | GB | 68 | 6 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | JP | 68 | 6 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | MX | 68 | 6 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

It is interesting to see that most countries in the dataset have the same popularity value for some tracks, except the US and CA. The versions of the most popular songs also vary more in these markets.
Further insights on Spotify's data collection techniques would be great to understand better why these values are static across markets.

## 4. What is the average and median popularity of the tracks?
### Median
Since mySQL doesn't really have a function to calculate the median of a column directly, alternative routes which involve session variables and subqueries are necessary:
```SQL
SET @row_index = -1;

SELECT ROUND(AVG(subq.popularity), 2) as median_popularity
FROM (
    SELECT 
      @row_index := @row_index + 1 AS row_index, 
      popularity
    FROM spotify_track_info
    ORDER BY popularity
  ) AS subq
  WHERE subq.row_index 
  IN (FLOOR(@row_index / 2) , CEIL(@row_index / 2));
```
| median_popularity |
| --- |
| 65.00 |

### Average
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) AS avg_popularity
FROM spotify_track_info
```
|avg_popularity|
| --- |
|66.14 

## 5. What is the average and median popularity of the tracks, per country?
### Median
Since the process to calculate the median can be simplified by using the *MariaDB* mySQL system, it should be noted that all the answers from this point on are obtained through that variation.
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT
market,
MEDIAN(popularity) OVER(PARTITION BY market) AS median_popularity
FROM df_spotify_tracks
```
| market | median_popularity |
| -- | -- |
| CA | 60 |
| DE | 66 |
| FR | 66 |
| GB | 66 |
| JP | 66 |
| MX | 66 |
| US | 60 |

### Average
```SQL
SELECT
market,
ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) AS avg_popularity
FROM df_spotify_tracks
GROUP BY market
```
| market | avg_popularity |
| -- | -- |
| CA | 62.60 |
| DE | 67.70 |
| FR | 67.70 |
| GB | 67.70 |
| JP | 67.70 |
| MX | 67.70 |
| US | 62.60 |

It is worth noting that the popularity values are identical across all markets for the same songs. After some [research](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/question-about-the-popularity-score-of-an-artist/m-p/5795193), it was found that the popularity metrics are global aggregates and therefore will be the same for all markets. 

## 6. Are audio features also global aggregates?

```SQL
SELECT market,
ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) AS avg_popularity,
ROUND(AVG(danceability), 3) AS avg_danceability,
ROUND(AVG(energy), 3) AS avg_energy,
ROUND(AVG(loudness), 3) AS avg_loudness,
ROUND(AVG(duration_ms)/60000, 3) AS avg_duration_mins,
ROUND(AVG(tempo)) AS avg_tempo
FROM df_spotify_tracks
GROUP BY market
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
```
| market | avg_popularity | avg_danceability | avg_energy | avg_loudness | avg_duration_mins | avg_tempo |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| DE | 67.70 | 0.391 | 0.543 | -13.016 | 5.174 | 120 |
| FR | 67.70 | 0.391 | 0.543 | -13.016 | 5.174 | 120 |
| GB | 67.70 | 0.391 | 0.543 | -13.016 | 5.174 | 120 |
| JP | 67.70 | 0.391 | 0.543 | -13.016 | 5.174 | 120 |
| MX | 67.70 | 0.391 | 0.543 | -13.016 | 5.174 | 120 |
| CA | 62.60 | 0.378 | 0.529 | -14.761 | 5.185 | 132 |
| US | 62.60 | 0.378 | 0.529 | -14.761 | 5.185 | 132 |

Since the averages are the same for all countries, it is safe to assume that the audio features are global aggregates as well.


## 7. How many tracks have danceability and energy above the dataset's average?
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS above_than_average
FROM df_spotify_tracks
WHERE danceability > (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM df_spotify_tracks)
AND energy > (SELECT AVG(energy) FROM df_spotify_tracks)
```
| above_than_average |
| -- |
| 14 |

### 7.1 Please display these tracks
```SQL
SELECT track_name, market, popularity
FROM df_spotify_tracks
WHERE danceability > (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM df_spotify_tracks)
AND energy > (SELECT AVG(energy) FROM df_spotify_tracks)
```

| track_name | market | popularity |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Paranoid - 2012 - Remaster | CA | 77 |
| N.I.B. | CA | 60 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | DE | 84 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | DE | 68 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | FR | 84 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | FR | 68 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | GB | 84 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | GB | 68 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | JP | 84 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | JP | 68 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | MX | 84 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | MX | 68 |
| Paranoid - 2012 - Remaster | US | 77 |
| N.I.B. | US | 60 |


## 8. Are tracks with an above average danceability, energy also among the loudest?
```SQL
WITH LoudestTracks AS(
    SELECT DISTINCT
    track_name, 
    loudness,
    popularity,
    danceability,
    energy
FROM df_spotify_tracks
),

AboveAvgDE AS(
    SELECT track_name
FROM df_spotify_tracks
WHERE danceability > (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM df_spotify_tracks)
AND energy > (SELECT AVG(energy) FROM df_spotify_tracks)
)

SELECT DISTINCT LT.track_name,
    LT.loudness,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY LT.loudness DESC) as loudness_rank
FROM LoudestTracks AS LT
INNER JOIN AboveAvgDE AS AA ON LT.track_name = AA.track_name
ORDER BY loudness_rank ASC
```
| track_name | loudness | loudness_rank |
| -- | -- | -- |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | -9.403 | 1 |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | -9.651 | 6 |
| N.I.B. | -10.586 | 11 |
| Paranoid - 2012 - Remaster | -12.051 | 13 |

They are among the top 20 loudest Black Sabbath tracks as well.

## 9. Are they also amongst the most popular Black Sabbath tracks?

```SQL
WITH LoudestTracks AS(
    SELECT DISTINCT
    track_name, 
    loudness,
    popularity,
    danceability,
    energy
FROM df_spotify_tracks
),

AboveAvgDE AS(
    SELECT track_name
FROM df_spotify_tracks
WHERE danceability > (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM df_spotify_tracks)
AND energy > (SELECT AVG(energy) FROM df_spotify_tracks)
)

SELECT DISTINCT LT.track_name,
    LT.popularity,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY LT.popularity DESC) as popularity_rank
FROM LoudestTracks AS LT
INNER JOIN AboveAvgDE AS AA ON LT.track_name = AA.track_name
ORDER BY popularity_rank ASC
```

| track_name | popularity | popularity_rank |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Paranoid (2009 - Remaster) | 84 | 1 |
| Paranoid - 2012 - Remaster | 77 | 6 |
| N.I.B. (2009 - Remaster) | 68 | 8 |
| N.I.B. | 60 | 13 |

Yes, they are.

# Conclusions
In general, the most important insights we got from accessing the API were: 
1. Although we are given the option to get the data from different markets, track audio features and track popularity indexes are global aggregates, and should only be included in analysis as global track information. Artist popularity indexes are global metrics as well. Market segmentation could be more relevant for extracting data about playlists.
2. There seem to be hints of a highly positive correlation between loudness, popularity and more 'eclectic' audio features like danceability and energy, on the tracks where these features are above the average.
